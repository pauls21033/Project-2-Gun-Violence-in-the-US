# State's Gun Policies Effectiveness on the Number of Mass Shootings 

## Description

Our motivation for this project was to define differing levels of a States' gun policies and monitor their affects on the number of mass shootings per State.  We have built this project to see if there are any viable correlations between levels of policy and mass shootings.  This can help solve the problem of gun policy effectiveness on the occurances of mass shootings.

## Extract

We used the following original data sources for this project: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gunviolencearchive/gun-violence-database![image] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_the_United_States_by_sta ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_the_United_States_by_state)

The data used from Kaggle are all CSV files, using while the data used Wikipedia is a scraped website

The analyzed date defines a mass shooting as an gun event where at least two or more persons were injured or killed

## Transform

With the Wikiepdia data we scraped the website to use the data to set parameters for how we were going to relate the differing levels of State's gun policy.  We took the total number of policies per the data and divided them by the number of active gun policies a State was using when a mass hooting happened.


                                      
                       
## Load

The final database we used to best compare mass shooting and gun policies was a relational database stored in tables



## Report

We have concluded that a State's gun laws and policies do not affect the number of mass shootings
